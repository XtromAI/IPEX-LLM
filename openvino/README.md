# OpenVINO Workflow

This section contains OpenVINO-based inference workflows for Intel hardware.

## 🚧 Under Development

This section is currently being set up. Documentation and scripts will be added soon.

## Overview

OpenVINO (Open Visual Inference and Neural network Optimization) toolkit is Intel's solution for optimizing and deploying AI inference across various Intel hardware platforms.

### Target Hardware
- Intel CPUs (various generations)
- Intel integrated GPUs
- Intel discrete GPUs (Arc series)
- Intel Neural Compute Stick
- Intel Movidius VPUs

### Supported Model Formats
- OpenVINO IR (Intermediate Representation)
- ONNX
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch (via conversion)
- PaddlePaddle

## Planned Features

- [ ] Model conversion scripts
- [ ] Inference examples
- [ ] Benchmarking tools
- [ ] Integration examples
- [ ] Performance optimization guides

## Getting Started

Documentation will be added as this section develops.

### Prerequisites
- Intel hardware (CPU/GPU)
- Python 3.8+
- OpenVINO toolkit

### Installation
